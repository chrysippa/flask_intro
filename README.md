# Flask to-do app
A basic app that helped me learn Flask and Python virtual environments.

## General info
This is a to-do web app connected to a SQLite instance for storing entries. Not intended for reuse - it was a learning project.

## Technologies
* Python
* Flask 2.2.3
* virtualenv
* SQLAlchemy with SQLite

## Inspiration
This is my code for the ["Learn Flask for Python"](https://youtu.be/Z1RJmh_OqeA) tutorial.
